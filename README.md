 Just some stuff I've made messing around with ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/chat)

# Included in this project:
## [Anilist Activity History](/AnilistActivityHistory/)
Basically just gets the amount of activities on each day since first activity and displays them in a graph.
Uses data gotten from GDPR download.

## [osu! Key Overlay](/OsuKeyOverlay/)
A really crappy key overlay for osu!. Can't move it, haven't even tested it w/ osu open. **I advise against using it.** Was made just for fun like the rest of these.

## [osu! Replay Play Time Graph](/OsuReplayFilesTimes/)
Gets the time modified of each file within the /Data/r/ subdirectory of osu! and counts the amount per hour, plotting them on a scatter plot.
